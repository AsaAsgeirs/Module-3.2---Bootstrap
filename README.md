# Module-3.2---Bootstrap

I watched the Bootstrap tutorial and made the same website at first.
 Then I played around with diffrent codes from Bootstrap to change the website until I was pleased with it.
 I used white and gray colors to make the website clean and light, making the watches be the main part of the page.

<-- Navbar -->
the navbar is stuck to the top of the page when you scroll down so it is easy to access and it is transparent(opacity 75%) so it won't distract you while you are scrolling down.
the navbar also changes when you make the screen smaller, mobile view.
When you scroll down and want to get to the top again you can click ,,Seiko Watches Iceland" in the left corner of the navbar and it will bring you back up to the top.
Clicking ,,About Seiko" will bring you to the official Seiko website.
Clicking ,,Retailers" will bring you down to the bottom of the page where there are Cards with retail stores located in Iceland.
The ,,website" button inside the Cards transfers you to there online store.
Clicking the ,,Collection" button in the navbar brings you also to the offical Seiko website.

<-- Main content -->
It has the text on the left side of the container and the image on the right side.
I had trouble getting the Image to go above the text when you make the screen smaller. It just disappears, and couldn't find the code to fix it.
The ,,Buy Now" button transfers you to the official Seiko website to that specific watch.

<-- Logo / Footer -->
I put the Seiko logo in the footer of the page.
